    <p>LYRICS:</p>

    <p >Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while<br>
    Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies<br>
    Hoping for the best but expecting the worst<br>
    Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?<br><p>
      
    <p>Let us die young or let us live forever<br>
    We don't have the power but we never say never<br>
    Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip<br>
    The music's for the sad men<br></p>
   
    <p>Can you imagine when this race is won<br>
     Turn our golden faces into the sun<br>
     Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune<br>
     The music's played by the, the mad man<br></p>

    <p>Forever young, I want to be forever young<br>
     Do you really want to live forever?<br>
     Forever, and ever<br>
     Forever young, I want to be forever young<br>
     Forever young.</br>

    <p>Some are like water, some are like the heat<br>
    Some are a melody and some are the beat<br>
    Sooner or later, they all will be gone<br>
    Why don't they stay young?<br></p>

    <p>It's so hard to get old without a cause<br>
    I don't want to perish like a fading horse<br>
    Youth's like diamonds in the sun<br>
    And diamonds are forever<br>
    So many adventures couldn't happen today<br>
    So many songs we forgot to play<br>
    So many dreams swinging out of the blue<br>
    We'll let 'em come true <br></p>
       
    <P>Forever young<br>
    I want to be forever young<br>
    Do you really want to live forever?<br>
    Forever, and ever<br>
    Forever young<br>
    I want to be forever young<br>
    Do you really want to live forever?<br>
    Forever, and ever<br></P>

    <p>Forever young<br>
    I wanna be forever young<br>
    Do you really want to live forever?<br>
     (Forever)<br></p>
